/* Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
Example 1:      Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]             Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:      Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]         Output: 9
Example 3:      Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]                     Output: 3
